    <p class="mb-4">The Lubawang people, also known as Lun Bawang, are an indigenous ethnic group native to the northern highlands of Sarawak, mainly in the Lawas and Limbang districts. They are part of the larger Dayak community and share close cultural ties with the Kelabit and Murut groups.</p>
    <p>The Lubawang speak the <em>Lun Bawang language</em>, which belongs to the Austronesian family. Traditionally, they lived in longhouses and practiced wet-rice farming, hunting, and fishing in the lush highland valleys.</p>
