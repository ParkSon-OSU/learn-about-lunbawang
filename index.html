    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To introduce and promote the Lun Bawang ethnic group.</p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Lun Bawang</strong> are an ethnic group found in Central Northern Borneo. They are indigenous to
      the southwest of Sabah (Sipitang, Tenom, Keningau) and the northern region of Sarawak (Lawas, Limbang, Miri),
      as well as the highlands of North Kalimantan (Long Bawan, Krayan, Malinau, Mentarang) and Brunei (Temburong District).
    </p>
    <p>
      They were among the last tribal groups on Borneo to renounce headhunting. The largest Lun Bawang groups include
      the Tagal, Tidung, Timugon, Sembakung, Paluan, Bookan, Kalabakan, and Serundung.

  <section id="history">
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      The Lun Bawang people are one of the native ethnic groups that have lived on the island of Borneo for hundreds of years.
      According to historians like Tom Harrisson (1959) and S. Runciman (1960), they were among the earliest settlers in the
      central highlands of Borneo, closely related to the Kelabit tribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lun Bawang language is part of the Kelabit language family, and their dialects are similar. It is believed that
      the Lun Bawang originally lived in the Kerayan-Kelabit highlands in Central Northeast Borneo and gradually migrated
      to the lowlands of Sabah, Sarawak, and Brunei during the 17th and 18th centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their strong clan identity is reflected in how they name themselves after their regions—such as “Lun Adang” from
      the Adang River area, or “Lun Kemaloh” from the Kemaloh River area. Over time, cultural and linguistic variations
      developed between the Lun Bawang and Kelabit people.

    <h2>Culture and Traditions</h2>
    <p>
      Traditionally, the Lun Bawang people are farmers, cultivating rice and vegetables while also raising chickens, pigs,
      and buffaloes. They are skilled hunters and fishermen, depending heavily on the forests and rivers around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Music plays a significant role in their culture, especially bamboo instruments like the <em>suling</em>. The Lun Bawang
      are also known for their colorful traditional clothing worn during festivals and ceremonies.

  <section id="festival">
    <h2>Irau Aco Lun Bawang Festival</h2>
    <p>
      Every year on June 1st, the Lun Bawang community celebrates <strong>Irau Aco Lun Bawang</strong> in Lawas, Sarawak.
      Originally a thanksgiving ceremony for a successful rice harvest, it has grown into a grand cultural celebration.
      The event features traditional performances, a beauty pageant called <em>Ruran Ulung</em>, and the <em>ngiup suling</em>
      (bamboo music performance).
